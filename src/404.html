  <p>This is hands down one of the strangest quirks I have ever encountered in web development: You must ensure the total size of your 404.html page is greater than 512 bytes, because if it isn’t IE will disregard it and show a generic browser 404 page instead. When I finally figured this out, I had to crack a beer to help cope with the amount of time it took.</p>
  <p>n order to capture and restore the URL the user initially navigated to, you’ll need to add the following script tag to the head of your index.html page before any other JavaScript acts on the page’s current state:</p>
  <p>This bit of JavaScript retrieves the URL we cached in sessionStorage over on the 404.html page and replaces the current history entry with it. However you choose to handle things from there is up to you, but I’d use popstate and hashchange if you can.</p>
